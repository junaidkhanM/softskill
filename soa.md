# SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)

Service-oriented architecture(SOA), is an approach for distributed systems architecture that employs loosely coupled services, standard interfaces, and protocols, to deliver seamless cross-platform integration. It is used to integrate widely divergent components, by providing them with a common interface and a group of protocols for them to communicate through an [enterprise service bus](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/esb).

## letâ€™s take an example.

Suppose I want to build an application for a mall in my city for their parking ticket online. well, I can spend a month developing a subsystem that functions as a street map, another subsystem for payment, and another for user authentication and login, and so on. or could I simply avail street map service from google map, payment gateway service from PayPal and user login service from Facebook.

My job then would be to integrate these different services by creating some common process that guides the user through the use of these different services to deliver the desired functionality. So, instead of building an application that was based around all my different internal components within my well-bounded piece of software, my new application would instead be built with an architecture that is oriented around services. A service-oriented architecture.

## Why Service-Oriented Architecture Is Important?

There are many benefits to service-oriented architecture, especially in web service-based businesses. Below are a number of the advantages in brief:

* **Reusability:** The reusability of services makes it much easier and faster to assemble applications, instead of developers starting from scratch each time. 

* **Scalability:** Since SOA permits services to meet multiple services, platforms, and programming languages, scalability is greatly increased. And SOA uses a uniform communication protocol, allowing enterprises to decrease interaction between clients and services. Decreasing this level of interaction allows apps to be scaled with less pressure and inconvenience.
  
* **Use legacy infrastructure in new markets:**  SOA makes it easier for developers to require the functionality of one platform or environment and scale and extend it to new ones.
  
* **Reduced costs from greater agility and more efficient development of application**

* **Easy to maintain:** All services are self-contained and independent, they will be modified and updated as required without affecting other services.
  
* **Reliability:** Because it's easier to debug smaller services than large code, SOA generates apps that are more reliable.
  
* **The convenience of availability:** SOA facilities are available to anyone.

## Summary

In conclusion, I can say that as web application technologies still evolve there'll be a rise within the number of companies that utilize the facility of SOA. By switching to a uniform communication protocol, engineers are going to be ready to create software applications without having to stress about the languages on which platforms are built. In addition, SOA can help make sure that applications are often easily scaled, while at an equivalent time decreasing the prices that are often encountered when developing business service solutions.
